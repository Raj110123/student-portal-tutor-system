## 🚀 Features

* **Curriculum-Bound Reasoning** — AI constrained to faculty-approved knowledge graphs and course artifacts.
* **Concept Mastery Tracking** — Per-student concept heatmaps, Bloom’s taxonomy mapping, mastery timelines.
* **Misconception Detection & Remediation** — Identify wrong mental models and deliver targeted remediation.
* **Multimodal Adaptive Learning** — Speech-first interaction, text + visual summaries, accessibility adaptations.
* **Academic Integrity Controls** — Question rotation, leakage/anomaly detection, audit trails.
* **Teacher Dashboard & Insights** — Explainable analytics: class trends, misconception clusters, remediation recommendations.
* **Closed-Loop Cycle** — Query → Concept ID → Mastery & Gap Analysis → Adaptive Explanation → Remediation → Faculty Insight Update.

## 🎯 Problem

Universities currently depend on unregulated AI and static LMSs, causing:

* Knowledge leakage and hallucinations from generic models
* Surface learning due to no concept-level tracking
* Repeated failures from missing prerequisite analysis
* Unequal learning without accessibility adaptation
* Reactive (not proactive) faculty intervention

Universities need a mission-critical assistant that enforces curriculum boundaries, measures mastery, detects misconceptions, and gives actionable, explainable insights to educators.

## 💡 Solution

Edumentor AI provides a closed-loop academic intelligence system comprised of:

1. **Curriculum Engine**

   * Faculty-approved knowledge graph, course artifact mapping, prerequisite dependency graph.

2. **Mastery & Misconception Engine**

   * Concept-level mastery scoring, Bloom’s taxonomy alignment, targeted remediation plans.

3. **Multimodal Renderer**

   * Dynamic explanations with TTS, structured visual summaries, and accessibility options.

4. **Integrity & Analytics**

   * Leakage detection, question rotation, audit logs, student & class analytics dashboards.
